        What is PoliFix?
      </h4>
      <p>
        PoliFix is a honesty-geared platform for interaction between politicians and their constituents.
        PoliFix gives a voice to all in the community, regardless of race, gender, social class, etc. To promote political
        awareness, citizens can anonymously vote on polls, participate in topic discussions, and view the accountability
        meter of a registered politician. Meanwhile, politicians can post polls and questions to gauge the opinions
        of the American people. PoliFix aims to facilitate communication and push for a more honest tomorrow.
